Fortunately, scikit-learn provides us with so-called pipelines (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/pipeline.html), where feature construction and estimation can be chained during cross-validation.\n\nFor this to work, you need the feature construction in the fit-transform scheme of sklearn. I reused the code of den3b to do exactly this. Maybe it is useful for people who did not know this before or are just too lazy ;)",
